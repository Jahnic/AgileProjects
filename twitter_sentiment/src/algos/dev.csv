0,"@JetBlue Tell me more üò≥...

Because I need a 1 way to NYC, and I might choose you"
0,@SouthwestAir If you read my tweet it is a gap in process for folks that take multiple flights in one day.

0,"@USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less"
0,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
