0,"@USAirways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, ""because I told you to!"" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable!"
0,@AmericanAir wasn't just a delay. Your counter wouldn't take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass

0,@SouthwestAir my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE
0,@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
0,"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"

0,@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.
0,"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
1,@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues
0,@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
0,@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
0,@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
0,@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.

0,@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
0,@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
0,@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.
1,@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
0,@USAirways  is there a better time to call? My flight is on Friday and I need to change it. Worried I may be on hold until then.
0,@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
0,@SouthwestAir k but who won destination dragons
0,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
0,@united where is my flight voucher?
0,@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
0,@SouthwestAir RDU flights expected to be ok this afternoon and tonight?
0,@AmericanAir merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues

1,"@AmericanAir Hmm. Looks like you looked at my tweet from last month, not this one. Was able to get U.K. agent to help me, thanks."
1,@USAirways 1899. Thanks

0,@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
0,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!

0,@SouthwestAir have a prompt for consumers for prompt for customer service instead of having customers on hold for 1.5 hrs
0,@united I just sent to you.
